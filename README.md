_A Linux program to create a Windows USB stick installer from a real Windows DVD or image._

This package contains two programs:

* woeusb: A command-line utility that enables you to create your own bootable Windows installation USB storage device from an existing Windows Installation disc or disk image
* woeusbgui: A GUI wrapper of woeusb based on WxWidgets

Supported images:

Windows Vista, Windows 7, Window 8.x, Windows 10. All languages and any version (home, pro...) and Windows PE are supported.

Supported bootmodes:

* Legacy/MBR-style/IBM PC compatible bootmode
* Native UEFI booting is supported for Windows 7 and later images (limited to the FAT filesystem as the target)

This project is a fork of [Congelli501's WinUSB software](http://en.congelli.eu/prog_info_winusb.html), which has not been maintained since 2012, according to the official website.
